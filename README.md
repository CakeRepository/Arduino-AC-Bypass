# Arduino-AC-Bypass
Got a terrible AC unit? Got an arduino and some spare sensors!

What is needed 1 5V Relay 1 24VAC voltage detector and 1 Arduino.

This project will work on any arduino you will just need to change the pins.

You don't need a display I had one laying around collecting dust.

Best of luck!
